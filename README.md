# R3F-Crate-Selling
Crate Selling scripts for R3F and Exile. Complete with infiSTAR logging functionality.
Join my Discord at http://discord.gamingatdeathsdoor.com if you have any problems.

Original Script found here: http://www.exilemod.com/topic/19038-sell-crates-at-wastedump-r3f-required/
My version, adds the pop tabs to the player, updates the player's respect and deletes the crate from the world.
Deleting the crate prevents other players from taking the money.

## Install Instructions

Replace or merge the files in the Exile.Mapname folder of your server with the ones found in this download.

Drop the pbo found in the addons folder into your own, server side.

If you use infiSTAR set _useInfiSTAR to true in relacher.sqf.

Configure everything else how you want it. Configurable things have comments next to them. DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!!!
